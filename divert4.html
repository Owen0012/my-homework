    <h1 id="head">WINDOWS 12 RELEASE</h1>
    <img src="img 10.jfif" alt="">
    <p>According to my sources who are familiar with these plans, Microsoft now intends to ship “major” versions of the
        Windows client every three years, with the next release currently scheduled for 2024, three years after Windows
        11 shipped in 2021.
        That said, we know Microsoft will release the next version of Windows 11, version 24H2, in late 2024. This makes
        it unlikely that we'll also see Windows 12 this year.

        Before its public appearance, Windows 12 will probably follow a similar release structure as other versions of
        Windows. For example, the first Windows 11 Insider Preview build was available a few days after Microsoft
        announced the OS and a few months before its public release.

        A similar timeline is expected for this version, so you should be able to access a pre-release build of Windows
        12 through the Windows Insider Program whenever that time comes.</p>

    <p>This year, Microsoft is expected to make both software and hardware-related AI announcements at Build 2024. This
        could include new features for Windows 11 and possibly a sneak peek at Windows 12. A highlight for consumers
        will be the all-new Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)-based Windows PCs featuring the Snapdragon X Elite and
        Snapdragon X Plus, with OEMs such as Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo showcasing their first set of ARM-powered Windows
        PCs.

        Leaks suggest that new Surface devices, specifically the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6, will be unveiled,
        with both x86-based and ARM-based models available. <button><a href="owenblog.html">click
