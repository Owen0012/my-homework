    <h1>Elon musk cybertruck</h1>

    <p>Tesla hasn’t included Cybertruck-specific production and delivery numbers so far in its quarterly releases, but
        Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy said in late April that the EV maker built 1,000 a week "just
        a couple weeks ago" as it continued to ramp up production. It's likely investors and analysts will get a
        Cybertruck update when Tesla holds its second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday evening after the close of
        trading.</p>

    <p>"Cybertruck is most certainly benefiting from being new to market, with a bunch of pent-up demand as a tailwind,"
        a Cox Automotive spokesperson told FOX Business. "And you’ll see the opposite impact in the rest of Tesla’s
        lineup of vehicles – the other four products are all quite old, and sales are down accordingly. In the auto
        market, being ‘new’ certainly has its benefits." <button><a href="owenblog.html">click
