    <p>One lucky Drake fan is going to be "super blessed" by the Canadian rapper during his next show following the
        Kansas
        City Chiefs' victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday.

        Drake, who is on his "It's All A Blur Tour" with fellow rapper J. Cole, shared a photo of his massive $1.15
        million
        bet he put on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl on Sunday night on Instagram.

        His reasoning behind the pick? "I can't bet against the swifties," he captioned the photo. <button><a
