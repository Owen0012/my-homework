    <h1 id="head">NEWS ON DONALD TRUMPH ASSASINATION ATTEMPT</h1>
    <img src="img 1.jfif" alt="">
    <p>Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been wounded in the right ear in an assassination
        bid by a gunman at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, drawing condemnation from world leaders.

        The 78-year-old former president was rushed off stage, with blood streaked across his face after the shooting in
        Butler County on Saturday while the suspected shooter and a rally attendee were killed and two spectators
        critically injured.

        Trump raised a defiant fist to the crowd as he was bundled away to safety, and said afterwards: “I was shot with
        a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”

        The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed in a news conference that the shooting was being treated as
        “an assassination attempt”.

        It identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the “subject involved” in the assassination attempt, the FBI
        said in a statement on Sunday.

        The US Secret Service said in a statement that the suspect “fired multiple shots toward the stage from an
        elevated position outside the rally” before being “neutralised” by agents.

    <p>In documenting the Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday afternoon that turned into an attempt on a former
        president’s life, Doug Mills, a veteran New York Times photographer, appeared to capture the image of a bullet
        streaking past former President Donald J. Trump’s head.

        That is the assessment of Michael Harrigan, a retired F.B.I. special agent who spent 22 years in the bureau.

        “It absolutely could be showing the displacement of air due to a projectile,” Mr. Harrigan said in an interview
        on
        Saturday night after reviewing the high-resolution images that Mr. Mills filed from the rally. “The angle seems
        a
        bit low to have passed through his ear, but not impossible if the gunman fired multiple rounds.”

        Simple ballistic math showed that capturing a bullet as Mr. Mills likely did in a photo was possible.</p>
