    <p>Food is at the core of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN's development agenda for the 21st
        century. It is ranked second of the UN's 17 SDGs and the goal is to "End hunger, achieve food security and
        improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture."

        Despite this, the world is not on track to achieving Zero Hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number
        of people that will be affected by hunger will surpass 840 million in 2030.

        As of 2020, 11.7% of the world population of 7.753 billion humans are faced with acute food insecurity and
        hunger. According to a report by the World Food Program, nearly two in ten people on earth are starving and as
        many as 828 million people go to bed hungry every night, and the number of those facing extreme food insecurity
        has soared - from 135 million to 345 million - since 2019 plus, a total of 50 million people in 45 countries are
        right on the edge of famine.

        But where does Nigeria stand in the midst of all these and is there hope for this Nation?

        Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in the world and with more than 200 million people, it stands as
        the most populated country in Africa and the seventh largest in the world. The annual growth rate of the
        population is approximately 2.7 percent, and more than half the population is under 30 years of age. In another
        report by the WFP (World Food Programme), it is noted that around 110 million Nigerians, representing over 60
        percent of the total population, live below the poverty line.</p>
